# Product Details Section

[Demo](https://product-details-section.vercel.app/)

Welcome to my product details section project for a fictional e-commerce platform.
This section is designed to be fully functional and responsive, providing users with detailed product information and interactive features.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created a responsive product details page that includes options for product selection, review ratings, a gallery of images, and essential information like fabric care and shipping. The page dynamically updates based on the selected product options.

### Dynamic Product Information

- **Price and Discounts**: Displays list price vs. sale price, with discount labels for percentage and cash discounts.
- **Product Reviews**: Shows average rating and rating stars, with a link to view all reviews or a message for no reviews.
- **Product Image Gallery**: Displays multiple images, allowing users to select thumbnails to view different images. Images update according to the selected color variant.
- **Product Options**: Includes color swatches and size options, with different states for normal, hover, focus, selected, and out-of-stock. Updates available sizes based on the selected color.

### Interactivity

- **Quantity Modifier and Add to Cart**: Users can adjust the quantity of the product and add it to their cart. Quantity buttons are disabled based on stock availability.
- **Information Accordion**: Provides expandable sections for features, fabric care, shipping, and other product details.

### Responsive Design

- **Text Size**: Adjusts based on screen width.
- **Responsive Layout**: Stacks content vertically on smaller screens and aligns horizontally on wider screens.

### Cross-browser Compatibility

- Ensured compatibility with major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

## Tech Stack

- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Next.js**
- **React.js**
- **Daisy UI** for frontend components
